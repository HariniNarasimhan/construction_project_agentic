A construction agent implementation with MCP tools and UV integration.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- UV package manager
- Git
- Claude Desktop

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HariniNarasimhan/construction_agent.git
cd construction_agent/mcp_servers
```

2. Install UV if you haven't already:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```
4. Download and install Claude Desktop from http://claude.ai/download

5. We'll need to configure Claude for Desktop for whichever MCP servers you want to use. To do this, open your Claude for Desktop App configuration at ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json in a text editor. Make sure to create the file if it doesn't exist. If you have VS code installed

    <details>
    <summary>MacOS/Linux</summary>
    
    ```bash
    code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    ```
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Windows</summary>

    ```bash 
    code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
    ```
    </details>

6. Add the mcp server in the ```mcpServers``` key
    ```json
    {"mcpServers": {
    "building": {
            "command": "uv",
            "env": {
                "BUILDING_DIR":"<path to github repo>/construction_agent/building_data"
            },
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "<path to github repo>/construction_agent/mcp_servers",
                "run",
                "main.py"
            ]
        }
    }
    }
    ```

7. Save the file, and restart Claude for Desktop.

8. You can now see totally of 9 "building" mcp tools in the Claude desktop
